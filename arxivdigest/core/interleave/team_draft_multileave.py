    The multileaver will select systems at random for each multileaving,
    but systems that have fewer impressions will be preferred.
    This ensures that all systems will get a fair chance to be in approximately
    the same amount of multileavings.

    The multileaving is performed by letting systems propose elements in
    rounds, the order of the rounds are randomised each round. This is done
    until the multileaved rankings is the desired length, or the systems
    rankings are empty.

    Systems are give credit for elements they propose. The only exception for
    this is if there is a common prefix in the rankings included in the
    multileaving, then the common prefix is added to the multileaving
    without giving credit to any system.
